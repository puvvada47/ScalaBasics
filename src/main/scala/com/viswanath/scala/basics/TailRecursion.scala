           The tail recursive functions better than non tail recursive functions
           (Stack Overflow Function)
            because tail-recursion can be optimized by compiler.

            A recursive function is said to be tail recursive
            if the recursive call is the last thing done by the function.

            There is no need to keep record of the previous state

            Scalaâ€™s tail recursion optimizations can address this issue
            by reducing the call stack to just one frame since we didnot need to preserve
            the previous state.
